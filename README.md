## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Reddit
*Seeing thousands of user submitted post on certain topics
*Being able to see people commenting on the post or answering the post on certain questions
*Being able to join subreddits that I enjoy and scroll through them for a long time 

CamScanner
*Being able to scan my work on paper into pdf and more readable compared to a camera
*I can crop the notes I want to be scanned
*I can share scanned notes to myself so I can upload them as pdf

Google Maps
*I can see what trains option I can take to get to my location
*I can see what shops are around me if I want to explore a location
*The user UI is easy to understand and I can navigate through the app easily

Discord
*I can text and sends GIF to my friends privately through discord
*Being able to join servers to chat with other people that you have never met before
*I can add bots to my own server, like a music bot or game bot to spice up a discord server

An app idea that I have in mind would be first called GameBrain as this app would have many features related to video games. One of the features that this app
would have is video game news, it's hard to keep up with video game news these days as there are a lot of games coming out these days. As a gamer you don't
want to miss some exciting news whether it is a new trailer drop or an interview with the game developers, Gamebrain would have a news tab to show off that
news from various websites. Another feature that I would like to implement in this app is having a tab that shows all types of games and where you can buy the
game, it would show the video game and then it would have a list of stores you can purchase the game from. Another feature I would like to add is to show which
store had that video game for the lowest amount. It helps the user keep an eye out on that particular store if they want the game at its lowest price. The last
feature I would like to implement is having some sort of game quiz that the user can do to test their video game knowledge. One quiz would be about a
particular video game or something general about video games. Each quiz would have 5-10 questions.

## Notes

Learning where all the buttons are in Xcode, but playing around with Xcode for a bit helped me familiarize the layout of Xcode
